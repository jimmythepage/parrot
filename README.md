# Parrot ðŸ¦œ - Version 0.1

## Overview
**Parrot** is a Chrome extension that streamlines the note-taking process during work calls. It captures audio, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper model, and uses GPT to generate concise notes, which are then uploaded to a specified Notion page.

Warning: there isn't yet a packaged distribution.
