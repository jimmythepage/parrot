Parrot - Version 0.1 ü¶ú
Description üìù
Parrot is a Chrome extension designed to streamline your note-taking process during work calls. It captures audio from a Chrome tab, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper model, and then employs GPT-3 to generate concise notes. These notes, along with the transcriptions, are then conveniently uploaded to a specified page in Notion. Parrot is ideal for professionals who need to maintain accurate records of meetings and calls while focusing on the conversation.
